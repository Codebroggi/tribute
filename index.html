    <p>Edmund Burke was an Irish statesman as well as an author, orator, political theorist, and philosopher who, after moving to London, served as a member of parliament  for many years in the House of Commons with the Whig Party. Burke was a strong proponent of maintaining solid moral virtues in society, and of the importance of religion in attaining that virtue and keeping society together.</p>
